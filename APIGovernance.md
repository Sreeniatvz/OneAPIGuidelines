## What is API Governance?
API Governance is establishing, enforcing of the policies, and continuously monitoring of their proper implementation, by the members of the governing body of an organization. And API governance provides a policy-driven approach that helps to enforce standards and checkpoints throughout the API lifecycle, this not only encompasses the runtime but also design, development. 
This governance includes the best practices, guidelines, standards, design, development, deployment testing, documentation, security, runtime and overall operations.

API stands for Application Programming Interface,mainly API's were desinged and developed to integrating the homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The rise of HTTP Services, which includes new majority REST APIs, traditional SOAP-based APIs, and other, lead APIs technology for building mash-up applications, getting data and services to mobile applications, and connecting enterprises to their partners and cloud services. 

APIs have started their new life in modern elastic, social, mobile world. With the modern Web APIs dramatically growing, and high availability through the internet, increasingly business values, and becoming more and more important as the application landscape of enterprises, APIs quality (security, performance, availability, â€¦) and risk from exposing data and services by using open APIs
become main concerns to enterprises. Thus, API management is becoming a very important core component in modern service infrastructure. In this section, the rise, development, and importance of API management are described and discussed.

## API Governance addresses:
1. Tracking the life-cycle of each API from inception to sun-setting.
2. API Security Model employed and the details of managing it.
3. Defines the API interface standards.
4. Gathering statistics of both the Developer Portal and API Gateway usage.
5. Enabling the monetization of APIs.
6. API versioning


## Scope of the API Governance.
API governance incorporates the following stages or activities. 
1.	New API proposal 
2.	Requirements gathering 
3.	Design 
4.	Develop 
5.	Enforcing policies & Standards 
6.	Testing 
7.	Publishing & Documentation 
8.	Adoption / Consumption  
## New API proposal
This event happens when if any of the following business contract or agreement changes.
1.	Business wants to expose new functionality 
2.	Business asked changes on existing APIs.
3.	Changes in existing agreement with vendors or business partners.
## Requirements gathering 
In this stage or activity the API architects and business analysts work together to create API definitions. The API governance
team defines the process,polices and standards for the API interface. 
Here are the list of questions and standards enforced by Goverance team .

1. Which API specifications standards should be used? Swagger or RAML documentation? 
2. Who is responsible for the reviewing and approving the of the API. Product Owner or Business Owner
3. What are common APIGEE policies are applied or added to this API.
4. What is the auntentication, authroization scheme used.
5. Identifying which back-end services are connected to API's. Is there field mappings.

## Design & Develop
Once API specificaiton and requirements gathering is completed then the API development process starts. During the design & development phase API governance team must enforces the following guidelines .

1. Tools used for the entire API development lifecycle .
2. Which source code repositroy used for configuration management.
3. Enforcing best practices & standards for API development.
4. Defining Testing approach ,tools,executing Load,performance & functional tests.
5. What are polices must be applied to the proxies, and reviewing the quality of API's
6. Defining the API proxy promotion process, from lover environments to higher (production) and eventually for the sunsetting the older      versions.
##  Publishing & Documentation 



## API Governance Rules
1. There should be a templete document for new/change request for exisitng API proposal. 
2. API must be conformant to the Verizon API REST guidelines.
3. Any newly proposed API must be complementary to the existing APIs and not a duplicate of the existing APIs.
4. Swagger and JSON schema must be used to define APIs
5. API Testing -good to use Swagger,POSTMAN( Google).
6. Version , Release histroy should be maintained.
7.
